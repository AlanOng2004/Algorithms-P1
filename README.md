# Algorithms-P1

Welcome to my personal repository for Algorithms, Part I, taught by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne at Princeton University via Coursera. This repo is a structured learning log of my journey through the course, including:

- My own implementations of algorithms taught in the lectures
- Notes that distil key concepts and ideas
- Test cases and explorations of edge conditions
- Occasional experiments and extensions beyond the course material

About the Course:
The course focuses on the foundational tools of algorithm design and analysis, including:

- Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)
- Stacks, Queues, and Linked Structures
- Elementary Sorting (Selection, Insertion, Shell)
- Efficient Sorting (Merge, Quick, 3-way Quick)
- Binary Search
- Priority Queues (Binary Heaps)
- Binary Search Trees and Ordered Data Structures

All implementations are written in Java, using only primitive types and basic arrays — in keeping with the course’s "no library" philosophy.

How This Repo Is Organised
Each folder corresponds to a lecture week or topic grouping:

bash
Copy
Edit
/src/
  mod1_hello_world/
  mod2_union_find/
  mod3_stacks_queues/
  mod4_sorting/
  mod5_priority_queues/
  mod6_binary_search_trees/
  ...
/notes/
  mod1.md
  mod2.md
  ...

Where possible, each topic includes:

- A Java implementation of the key data structures/algorithms
- A corresponding test or main file
- A markdown note summarising complexity, intuition, and edge cases

Status & Goals
I'm working through the course progressively, aiming to internalise both the "how" and "why" of each algorithm. See each week's folder or note file for updates and reflections.
