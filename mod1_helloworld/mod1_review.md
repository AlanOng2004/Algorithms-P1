# MOD 1: Hello, World

This module served as an introduction to Java programming in the context of the course's algorithmic focus. Although the programs were simple, the goal was to familiarise myself with the basic structure of Java, the compilation-execution workflow, and how standard input/output is handled in a clean, low-level style (without external libraries).

ðŸ“Œ Programs Implemented
HelloWorld.java
A classic introductory program that prints "Hello, World" â€” used to verify that the Java development environment is correctly configured.

HelloGoodbye.java
Accepts two command-line arguments and prints a greeting followed by a farewell, showcasing:

- Argument parsing via args[]
- Basic string manipulation
- Concatenation and formatting

RandomWord.java
A slightly more involved task that selects a random word from standard input. This helped reinforce:

- Using functions from algs4.jar
- Adding .jar files to referenced libraries 
- Setting up my coding environment

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practised

- Java program structure (main method, class naming, etc.)
- Command-line argument handling
- Standard input/output using course-specific libraries
- Random selection logic and control flow

ðŸ’¬ Reflection
While the programs were beginner-level, they laid the foundation for:

- Writing code without relying on IDE features
- Using command-line tools to compile and run .java files

These skills are important because later modules will demand a precise, low-level understanding of how input, loops, and memory are handled â€” especially when implementing data structures from scratch.
